    "Both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods in Python that are used to handle attribute access in objects. However, there is a significant difference between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__getattr__(self, name)`:\n",
    "   - `__getattr__` is called when an attribute is not found through normal attribute access (i.e., when the attribute is not present as an instance attribute or in the class hierarchy).\n",
    "   - This method is used for handling attribute retrieval only when the attribute is not found through regular means.\n",
    "   - It takes two parameters: `self` (the instance) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
    "   - It must return the value of the attribute or raise an `AttributeError` if the attribute cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "        # This method is called when an attribute is not found\n",
    "        return f\"Attribute {name} not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "print(obj.some_attribute)  # Output: \"Attribute some_attribute not found.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `__getattribute__(self, name)`:\n",
    "   - `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access on the object, whether the attribute exists or not.\n",
    "   - It is used for handling all attribute retrievals, even for existing attributes.\n",
    "   - This method is more powerful but also more dangerous than `__getattr__`, as it intercepts all attribute accesses, including those of special methods and attributes, potentially leading to infinite recursion if not used carefully.\n",
    "   - It takes two parameters: `self` (the instance) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
    "   - It must return the value of the attribute or raise an exception if the attribute cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __getattribute__(self, name):\n",
    "        # This method is called for every attribute access\n",
    "        return f\"Intercepted attribute access: {name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "print(obj.some_attribute)  # Output: \"Intercepted attribute access: some_attribute\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `__getattr__` is used for handling attribute retrieval only when the attribute is not found, while `__getattribute__` is used for intercepting and handling all attribute accesses, even for existing attributes. Due to the more powerful nature of `__getattribute__`, it should be used with caution to avoid unintended side effects or infinite recursion. In most cases, `__getattr__` is the method of choice for customizing attribute access in Python classes."

    "Properties and descriptors are both mechanisms in Python used to customize attribute access and provide control over how attributes are retrieved, set, or deleted. However, there are some differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Definition and Usage:\n",
    "   - Properties are a built-in feature of Python and are created using the `@property` decorator. They allow you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, which are called automatically when the attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted.\n",
    "   - Descriptors, on the other hand, are a more low-level and flexible mechanism for attribute access. They are objects that define one or more special methods, including `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__`. Descriptors can be used directly in classes, allowing for more fine-grained control over attribute access behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scope:\n",
    "   - Properties are defined on the class level. They apply to a specific attribute of the class and are accessible by instances of the class. Properties are typically used to modify the behavior of individual attributes.\n",
    "   - Descriptors are also defined on the class level, but they are more general and can be applied to multiple attributes across different classes. Descriptors can be used to create reusable and versatile attribute access behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mechanism:\n",
    "   - Properties use Python's descriptor protocol under the hood. When a property is accessed, the `__get__` method of the property descriptor is called to retrieve the attribute value. Similarly, the `__set__` method is called when the property is assigned a new value, and the `__delete__` method is called when the property is deleted.\n",
    "   - Descriptors, on the other hand, directly implement the descriptor protocol by defining the `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` methods. They can be used to intercept and control attribute access at a lower level than properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ease of Use:\n",
    "   - Properties are generally more straightforward to use and are commonly employed for simple attribute access customization. They are easy to define using the `@property`, `@attribute_name.setter`, and `@attribute_name.deleter` decorators.\n",
    "   - Descriptors require more explicit implementation of the descriptor protocol, making them more complex to use but also more powerful and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, properties and descriptors both provide ways to customize attribute access behavior in Python, but they differ in terms of scope, mechanism, and ease of use. Properties are a higher-level and more convenient way to define attribute access behavior for individual attributes, while descriptors offer a more versatile and low-level approach that can be applied to multiple attributes and classes."
